/**	`DOSingleton` is a generic class for Mac OSX and iOS that implements all the required methods to implement a singleton object. 
		It's designed for subclassing.

		### Subclassing Notes
		When subclassing `DOSingleton` you should think about your subclass as an ordinary class, `DOSingleton` makes sure that there is only one instance of your class.
		If you want to make your own initializer or override `-init` method your should check whether your singleton has already been initialized with `isInitialized` property to prevent repeated initialization.
